# How has your country's economic living standards changed over time in relation to the rest of the world?
Having held an interest in economics from my high school, days I have been interested in how living standards have changed for different countries over time. 


The most reliable and objective measure of economic living standards is still Per Capita GDP:
  It is a measure that takes the Gross Domesitc Product(value of economic output for a year) of a country and divides it by the population.

Anecdotally, too, it shows signs of accuracy that appear in socio-economic metrics such as migration patterns and life expectancy.
